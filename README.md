Camel Case - myVarName
Snake Case - my_var_name
Pascal Case - MyVarName
In Python, we generally use Snake Case.

Python is dynamically typed language, unlike Java. 
A variable's type can change throughout the code. 
In Java, we need to specifically mention the type and it can't change thorughout the code. That's why it is called statically typed language.

In Python, we can't convert a string to an integer unless the string is a number.
It will cause ValueError.
